<a href="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ombd.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-425" title="oh my battery's dead android app" src="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ombd.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160" /></a>After discussing safety at college with my parents, I thought why not develop an app that would automatically text my parents to let them know my phone is about to die. This way, they won’t be worried when my phone dies and they can’t reach me as they’ll at least have my last location to have an idea of where I am.

This is a game I developed in one day at the 1-week intensive Bootstrap class. Bootstrap is a computer programming language that uses algebra concepts. Throughout the week, we learned how to program in Racket. On the second to last day, we developed a fully working game from scratch. This is the game I programmed. The link also contains the source code to the game.

<h3>Word It</h3>
<a href="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/xo-word-it-app.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-139" title="one laptop per child word it application" src="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/xo-word-it-app-216x300.png" alt="" width="216" height="300" /></a>This is a computer application designed and programmed in four weeks at XO APPLab Summer Camp. I was the lead developer for a Python program that runs on the <a href="http://one.laptop.org/" target="_blank">One Laptop Per Child</a> (OLPC) laptops. We came up with the idea of a vocabulary game, Word It. The game was completely coded in Python. The game has two main game modes. The first one simply displays the word and definition on the screen for users to study. The second mode tests users' vocabulary by displaying a word, and displaying 4 random definitions with one of them being the correct one. The game also has internet functionality. It searches our server for words. If there is no internet connectivity, it uses the words defined in a separate file in the game's folder.

<a href="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mf2.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-38" title="mf2" src="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mf2-300x190.png" alt="" width="300" height="190" /></a>

This is the second year of Muslim Funfest apps I developed. The biggest feature is 'Find my Car.' The app saves the location of the user's car, then navigates users back to their car. The app also lists all of Muslim Funfest's attractions and an easy way to navigate to the event.

The app replies to incoming texts with a set user message. Perfect to let others know you're busy without actually pulling out your phone.</p>

<a href="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/color-tap.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-39" title="color tap" src="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/color-tap-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" /></a>I developed this app as a student in Youth APPLab. Every student had to develop an app at the end of Youth APPLab's program. This was my submission. Color Tap is a hand-eye coordination game. Circles rapidly change colors and bounce around the screen. The objective is to touch a circle when it is the target color, which also changes. You have a limited amount of time to do so.

<h3> Biz Card</h3>
<a href="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biz-Card-App.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-117" title="Biz Card App" src="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biz-Card-App.png" alt="" width="285" height="182" /></a>I developed this app during the 2011 Digital Media and Learning Conference.  A challenge was made from the audience for another student and I to build a completely working app of their choosing before we left the conference. Conference attendees tweeted their app ideas and agreed upon the development of a business card application.  To everyone's amazement, I developed this Biz Card app in less than 30 minutes.

<h3><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtcZJW762pY&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">NXT Robot Controller</a></h3>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-103" style="font-size: 13px;" title="NXT Robot Controller" src="http://www.hamzahawkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/NXT-Robot-Controller-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" />

I developed this app while I was a student of Youth APPLab. Our instructor always pushed us to develop our own app with the skills that we learned. She mentioned that there were options to include NXT robot functionality in our apps. I decided to utilize these options and make an app that controls NXT robots.
