                <p>
                    The story of who I am started when I was very young. When I was <strong>10 years old</strong>, I loved playing this racing 
                    game <strong>Midtown Madness: Chicago Edition</strong>. I had almost all the cars unlocked except for the very last one.
                    It was at this point where my computer had caught a virus and I had to get a new one.
                    I used to build my own computers then so I had got a new hard drive and motherboard and went from there.
                    Unfortunately there was no way to get the old save files from the game back. Because of this, I had to start from the beginning. 
                    I was very determined to get my progress back, but without actually playing through all those levels again.
                    I had an inclination to modify the new game saves that was created from the new game. I opened these files in notepad 
                    and edited some of the values that was set. From here I was able to restore my previous progress and cars by editing these values. 
                    I found this to be so fun. It was so fun to the point where I went to other files related to the game and then started to modify 
                    the game itself. Next thing you know, I was teaching myself how to mod different games and edit game saves. I didn't even know what 
                    this was called but I knew I enjoyed it. This set the tone for all the other things I got into later on in life.

                <h2>Before College</h2>

                <h4>Robotics</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the time when I was able to really cultivate my passion. I participated in a few after school programs that all were 
                    centered around me programming something. One of the first things that I did was participate in this robotics program. In this program 
                    I learned how to code in C++. I also learned how to program robots and I gained experience in how the hardware robotic part 
                    interacted directly with software. This was so cool to me. I could program a robot to maneuver through a maze. I could even program 
                    a robot to do different things based on the colors that the camera detected. I was really fascinated. I entered multiple compeitions 
                    and placed pretty decently. Of course placing high was fun, the real joy came out of the robot and my program 
                    accomplishing goals and competing in competitions.

                <a href="http://www.youthapplab.com" className="body-links"><h4>Youth App Lab</h4></a>
                <p>
                    My time in YouthAppLab had really shaped me and opened my eyes to programming and technology as a whole. Everything I did 
                    and experienced in this program is the reason why my passion for programming and technology is where it is and is why it continued to grow. 
                    From this, not only have I learned a lot and had countless experiences that opened my eyes to what is available in the world of tech, 
                    but I also left with two of the greatest mentors I could've possibly gained, and they are still my mentors to this day. 
                    <br /><br />
                    From my time in YouthAppLab, I've learned various things and had great experiences. I learned how to develop mobile apps. 
                    This was my first introduction to the tech side from a very broad perspective. 
                    At this time, smartphones was becoming the norm and a demand for mobile apps grew. 
                    From that experience and all the apps I made while in the program, the biggest thing 
                    I felt I got from it was not only the experience and skills itself, but also the mindset 
                    that i've developed thanks to my two mentors. It was the entrepreneurial spirit and passion to try new things 
                    and this mindset is something I'm really thankful for.

                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>
                    I could go on about my experiences and time in college, but I'd go on forever. I broke down the 
                    important highlights in 3 different sections, teaching/tutoring, entrepreneurial efforts, and Microsoft.
                </p>

                <h4>Teaching/Tutoring</h4>
                <p>
                    Something I love doing is giving back. I was an assistant teacher and mentor during my time 
                    at YouthAppLab and so going into college, I looked for opportunities to continue 
                    to give back. I had a bunch of different positions as a teacher. I'd work 
                    with YouthAppLab while I was in school when I'd have time, and I'd work for 
                    other various startups that went around middle schools to teach programming and 
                    robotics. My latest teaching/mentoring opportunity was with other college students 
                    as a TA for my university's computer science courses. Each of these opportunities 
                    was fun and fulfilling for me.

                <h4>Entrepreneurial Efforts</h4>
                <p>
                    From the entrepreneurial spirit that I acquired from being in YouthAppLab, 
                    I started my own entrepreneurial endeavors. I started two different big ventures, 
                    a software development and branding company and then a clothing line.

                    <h5>Snikwah</h5>
                    I started a company where I originally created computer games. Then, I moved on 
                    to mobile apps, games, websites, graphics, logos, business consultations, and just 
                    about anything someone would need to get a startup going or to help with branding 
                    in general. I plan to refine what this company does and grow it as my time frees up.

                    <a href="https://ablackgent.com" className="body-links"><h5>ABlackGent</h5></a>
                    I also started a clothing line. The inspiration behind this is from my Instagram 
                    and Twitter name, ABlackGentleman. Unfortunately there is constant negativity 
                    surrounding black men which in turns affects our black women. My agenda was to 
                    change this narrative and bring positivity to it and it started with my 
                    usernames for social media. I then utilized that for the name of the clothing line. 
                    The brand stands for positivity and expression while upholding high standards. This 
                    is something everyone should be striving for and in particular as a black man, this 
                    is something that I feel other black men should also strive for. This is also something 
                    that black women should demand from us, better black men.

                <a href="https://www.microsoft.com"><h4>Microsoft</h4></a>
                <p>
                    Acquiring an internship with Microsoft has been a very defining moment in my professional career. 
                    I remember the whole sequence of events and interviews that lead to my first 
                    internship at Microsoft. I had went to my very first college career fair during 
                    my very first semester of college. After talking to one of the recruiters 
                    at the career fair, I was placed in the different interviews that Microsoft had 
                    offered. At the end of it all, I acquired an internship as an explorer intern. Every 
                    summer for the past five summers have been spent as an intern at Microsoft and I've enjoyed 
                    each and every one.
